# Game of Life
This program was created to show implementation of John Conway's Game of Life.

# Rules of the game:

For a cell that is 'alive'(dark blue):

Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a cell that is 'empty' or 'dead'(light blue):
Each cell with three neighbors becomes alive.

We can change the speed of cells changing by pressing letter 's'. To stop/ start the game we need to press letter 'b'.
